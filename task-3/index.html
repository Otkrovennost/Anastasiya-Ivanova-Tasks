              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>
                The city of&nbsp;Petra, capital of&nbsp;the Nabataean Arabs, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous archaeological sites in&nbsp;the world, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;Located 240&nbsp;km south of&nbsp;the capital Amman and 120&nbsp;km north of&nbsp;the red sea town of&nbsp;Aqaba (see the Map), Petra the world wonder, is&nbsp;undoubtedly Jordan&rsquo;s most valuable treasure and greatest tourist attraction, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;visited by&nbsp;tourists from all over the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not known precisely when Petra was built, but the city began to&nbsp;prosper as&nbsp;the capital of&nbsp;the Nabataean Empire from the 1st century&nbsp;BC, which grew rich through trade in&nbsp;frankincense, myrrh, and spices. 
                Petra was later annexed to&nbsp;the Roman Empire and continued to&nbsp;thrive until a&nbsp;large earthquake in&nbsp;363&nbsp;AD destroyed much of&nbsp;the city in&nbsp;the 4th century&nbsp;AD.

              <h3>The Nabatean</h3>
              <p>
                The Nabataeans, an&nbsp;Arab tribe, first appeared in&nbsp;the sixth century&nbsp;BC in&nbsp;the desert located to&nbsp;the east of&nbsp;Jordan, and came from the south-east of&nbsp;the Arabian Peninsula. They settled first in&nbsp;Petra and subsequently expanded their territory to&nbsp;the Horan and Levant and finally announced Bosra as&nbsp;their capital.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to&nbsp;historical records, they are descendants&nbsp;of (Bnayut) the son of&nbsp;Ismail bin Ibrahim. Ismail had twelve boys who formed a&nbsp;tribe, most of&nbsp;whom were located in&nbsp;Najad. The father of&nbsp;the Nabataeans remained at&nbsp;Mount Shammar but was forced to&nbsp;run from the Ashurbanipal to&nbsp;Wadi Araba between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of&nbsp;Aqaba.

              <h3>One Of 7 Wonders</h3>
              <p>
                Renowned for its charm and ancient cultural heritage, Petra marks the achievement of&nbsp;an&nbsp;impressive civilization, the Nabataean Arabs, who perfectly carved the city into its mountains. It&nbsp;was considered the most important strategic location as&nbsp;a&nbsp;link and point of&nbsp;convergence between the Arabian Peninsula to&nbsp;the south and the Levant in&nbsp;the north, to&nbsp;the far country of&nbsp;China and to&nbsp;the heart of&nbsp;Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Siq is&nbsp;the main road that lies between the city&rsquo;s rose colored mountains, which stand at&nbsp;a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;80m and reach up&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;Km at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the Siq. When sightseeing, visitors will be&nbsp;astounded by&nbsp;the sight of&nbsp;the Treasury, which represents the masterpiece of&nbsp;the ancient city with a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;45m and width of&nbsp;30m, all of&nbsp;which is&nbsp;carved into the mountain.

              <p>
                It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the ancient main entrance leading to&nbsp;the city of&nbsp;Petra, starts at&nbsp;the Dam and ends at&nbsp;the opposite side of&nbsp;the vault, a&nbsp;split rock with a&nbsp;length of&nbsp;about 1200m and a&nbsp;width of&nbsp;3&nbsp;to&nbsp;12m, and height up&nbsp;to&nbsp;about 80m; most of&nbsp;the rock is&nbsp;natural and another part was sculptured by&nbsp;the Nabataeans. The Siq, the main road that leads to&nbsp;the city, starts from the Dam and ends at&nbsp;the Treasury. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock canal that measures 160 meters in&nbsp;length, 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;12&nbsp;meters in&nbsp;width and reaches up&nbsp;to&nbsp;80&nbsp;meters in&nbsp;height. The main part of&nbsp;the Siq is&nbsp;created by&nbsp;natural rock formation and the rest is&nbsp;carved by&nbsp;the Nabataeans.
